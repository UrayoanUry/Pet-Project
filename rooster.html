        <p>He was my pet rooster in Puerto Rico.</p>    
        <p>My grandparents gave him to me when I was 4.</p>
        <p>He lived until I was 12.</p>
        <p>But little did I know that my original pet rooster died when I was 5.</p>
        <p>My grandparents replaced him and did not tell me until I was 16.</p>
